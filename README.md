Mac-Changer

This is my first project made using python language.

Mac changer is a Python3 Tool for SECURITY TESTING PURPOSES ONLY!

This tool help in changing the MAC Address of the machine.

Just copy the URL and put this in terminal "git clone + URL" and hit enter.

Usage

$ python Mac-changer.py

It will ask for interface. If you are connected wirelessly to a network, choose wlan0. And if you are connected via ethernet then choose eth0.
then it will ask for the MAC address you want to put.

Then scan or choose any relevant MAC address and type it in then hit enter to change it and it will be done in a second.

Note :- If you are connected to a network in which you have to login on the IP of the router then do it again after changing the MAC to register new MAC address.
